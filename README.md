# wire-magnetic-field-simulation
python script to visualize magnetic fields around an infinitely long straight wire.

*tl;dr: computes the vector sum of the magnetic field for every wire (using formula B = k * I/r) for every pixel on the screen and displays it accordingly.*

- Green values represent lower values, red higher
- X and O represent the direction
